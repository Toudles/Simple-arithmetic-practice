Part 1: Determine Problem Type
Begin by asking the user to select the type of problem they want to solve (addition, subtraction, multiplication or "random") -- if they choose "random" you should select a problem type for them. If they don't select one of these four options you should tell them their selection is invalid and the program should end. Here's are a few sample runnings of this part of the assignment:

Part 2: Generate Random Problem
If the problem type is valid your program should then create a random problem of that type. The range of numbers that your program selects for these problems should all be within the range of 1 to 10. You should then ask the user for an answer to the problem which will be provided as an integer.

Part 3: Give the user a second chance
If the user guesses incorrectly on the first try you should give them a second chance. When doing this you should give the user a "hint" to let them know if their answer was too high or too low.

Part 3: Give the user a third chance
Finally, give the user a third chance to solve the problem if they guess incorrectly on try #2.
